# Integrating-Drain-Gating-and-Lector-Techniques-in-Ultra-Deep-Submicron-Technology-to-Reduce-Leakage

In devices using extremely deep submicron technology, short channel effects are found due to scaling. Leakage current flows through the transistor as a result of the short channel effect, increasing the circuits' static power dissipation. 

Two prominent leakage reduction approaches, drain gating and lector techniques, are integrated in this study to minimise the leakage power of CMOS VLSI circuits. For various input vectors, this new combination approach is used to mimic various logic circuits. 

The performance of the inverter and NOR gate is evaluated in terms of dc power dissipation and propagation delay, and the results are compared to leakage reduction techniques already in use. The performance of the inverter and NOR gate is evaluated in terms of dc power dissipation and propagation delay, and the results are compared to leakage reduction techniques already in use. 

The combined impact of drain gating and lector methods results in a significant reduction in leakage power. For 45nm technology, the suggested method decreases the leakage power consumption of the Drain gating NOR gate by 44 percent and the Lector NOR gate by 22 percent.
